## :heavy_check_mark: Checklist - Best Practices

Required actions are written in bold, other actions are recommended. Not all actions might apply to every research
project.

### :bar_chart: Data

- [ ] **Draw conclusions while considering dataset and experiment limitations**
- [ ] **Document task adequacy, representativeness and pre-processing**
- [ ] **Split the data such as to avoid spurious correlations**
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analyses to ensure quality and correctness
- [ ] Publish the dataset accessibly & indicate changes
- [ ] Be aware of the score differences required to claim significance

### :computer: Codebase & Models

- [ ] **Use a code repository (e.g. git) with proper documentation including licensing to distribu tecode for replicability** 
- [ ] **Report all details about hyperparameter search and model training**
- [ ] **Publish model predictions and evaluation scripts**
- [ ] **In the paper, specify the parameters used for replicability as well as the hardware requirements**
- [ ] Use efficient hyperparameter optimization methods
- [ ] Use of model cards

### :microscope: Experiments & Analysis

- [ ] **Report mean & standard deviation over multiple runs**
- [ ] **Perform significance testing or Bayesian analysis and motivate your choice of method**
- [ ] **Carefully reflect on the amount of evidence regarding your initial hypotheses**

### :page_facing_up: Publication 

- [ ] **Guarantee the replicability of experiments** 
- [ ] **Discuss the potential ethical & social impact**
- [ ] **Avoid citing pre-prints (if applicable)**
- [ ] Prioritize computational efficiency 
- [ ] Include an Ethics Statement
