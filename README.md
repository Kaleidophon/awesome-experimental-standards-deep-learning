## Experimental Standards for Deep Learning Research: 
### A Natural Language Processing Perspective

This repository contains supplementary material from [our paper of the same title](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06251). Since our paper can only capture the 
state of affairs at the time of publication, the idea here is to keep a more up-to-date version of the resources in the 
appendix here, and invite the community to collaborate in a transparent manner.

In [RESOURCES.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/RESOURCES.md),
we maintain a version of Table 1 in the original paper, giving an overview over useful resources for different stages of
the research process, namely Data, Codebase & Models, Experiments & Analysis, and Publication.

In [CHECKLIST.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md), 
we distil the actionable points at the end of the core paper sections into a reusable and modifiable checklist to ensure
replicability. 

In [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
we transparently document changes to the repository and versioning. The current version is v0.1.

### :jigsaw: Contributing

Contributing can come in two forms: Opening an issue to correct mistakes or improve the existing content, or adding new
content by opening pull requests.

When opening an issue, please label the issue accordingly:
* `enhancement-resources` for issues improving or correcting entries in [RESOURCES.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/RESOURCES.md).
* `enhancement-standards` for issues improving or correcting entries in [CHECKLIST.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md).
* `duplicate` for indicating duplicate entries.
* `general` for general questions / issues with the repository.

To contribute and add new content, please first check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file and read the contributing guideline before opening a pull request. Use the label 
* `enhancement-resources` for pull requests adding new resources and 
* `enhancement-standards` for pull requests adding new points to the checklist.

The pull request template can be checked under [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
