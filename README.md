## Experimental Standards for Deep Learning Research: 
### A Natural Language Processing Perspective

This repository contains supplementary material from our paper of the same title. Since our paper can only capture the 
state of affairs at the time of publication, the idea here is to keep a more up-to-date version of the resources in the 
appendix here, and invite the community to collaborate in a transparent manner.

In [RESOURCES.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/RESOURCES.md),
we maintain a version of Table 1 in the original paper, giving an overview over useful resources for different stages of
the research process, namely Data, Codebase & Models, Experiments & Analysis, and Publication.

In [CHECKLIST.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md), 
we distil the actionable points at the end of the core paper sections into a reusable and modifiable checklist to ensure
replicability. 

In [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Kaleidophon/experimental-standards-deep-learning-research/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
we transparently document changes to the repository and versioning. The current version is v0.1.
